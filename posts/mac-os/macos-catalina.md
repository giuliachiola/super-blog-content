After MacOS system upgrade to [Catalina](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/), on my computer **git** did not work anymore. If you happened the same, the following steps resolve it for me!

Running any of git commands, you would probably got this error

```shell
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun
```

To fix it, you had to run

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

The "xcode-select" command requires the command line developer tools.

A prompt will appear asking you to install it now.

When installation is completed, git should work as expected! ðŸ˜Ž
