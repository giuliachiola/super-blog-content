title: How to add generic styles in Vue Styelguidist
abstract: Vue Styleguidist is an awesome tool I used to build styleguides with Vue components. Here it is a way to add generic styles in all app components.

I was working on a styleguide project using [vue Styleguidist](https://github.com/vue-Styleguidist/vue-Styleguidist), the Vue little brother of [react-styleguidist](https://github.com/Styleguidist/react-Styleguidist), and I would like to organize components styles in this way:

- component specific styles would be inside the `[ComponentName].vue` file
- while all generic styles (colors, typography, and so on) would be inside a generic `styles.scss` file.

## The first (bad) idea

If I hadn't been in a Styleguidist app, but in a "normal" Vue app instead, I could have add a sass `@import` with all my generic styles at the highiest component, the `App.vue`:

```html
// App.vue

<template>
  <div id="app">
    ...
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'App',
}
</script>

<style lang="scss">
// generic styles
@import 'styles/styles.scss'
</style>
```

In this way, all components will have inherited my generic styles.

**But** in a Styleguidist project I have not such an high-level Vue component üò©

If I would to import a generic file in that way, I would have to add it into **all** my components, like this:

```html
// components/MyComponent.vue

<template>
  ...
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent',
}
</script>

<style lang="scss">
// generic styles
@import 'styles/styles.scss'

// my components custom styles
.c-my-component {
  background: red;
}

...
</style>
```

Not such a great idea! üßê

## The second (I think good?) idea

Probably there is a better way to do it, but for the moment I'll go with this! üòÖ

Adding a `vue.conifg.js` file to the Styleguidist project, I can tell to Styleguidist `sass-loader` which style content it has to prepend _before_ the actual component `<style>` content. This can be achieved using `sass-loader` [`additionalData`](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/#additionaldata) option

```js
// vue.config.js

module.exports = {
  css: {
    sourceMap: true,
    loaderOptions: {
      scss: {
        additionalData: `
        @import "assets/styles/styles.scss";
        `,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

> üß® **!important**
>
> In these examples I have assumed that we are using SASS (.scss) files and not simple CSS files.
> The `sass-loader` node package I mentioned before is already installed in my project because I wrote styles in SASS using the `<style lang="scss">` syntax.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Bonus tip

Since I have just added the `vue.config.js` file, I also added my [`postcss`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) configuration there:

```js
const postcssNormalize = require('postcss-normalize')
const postcssPresetEnv = require('postcss-preset-env')

module.exports = {
  css: {
    sourceMap: true,
    loaderOptions: {
      scss: {
        additionalData: `
        @import "assets/styles/styles.scss";
        `,
      },
      postcss: {
        plugins: () => [
          postcssPresetEnv({
            features: {
              'logical-properties-and-values': {
                dir: 'ltr',
              },
            },
          }),
          postcssNormalize(),
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Et voil√†! üá´üá∑

With this configuration:
- component specific styles are inside the `[ComponentName].vue` file
- while all generic styles are inside a generic `styles.scss` file

Please let me know if you found a better way to import general styles in Vue Styleguidist components! üòá
