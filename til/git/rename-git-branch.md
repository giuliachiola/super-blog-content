## Rename local branch

To rename a *local* branch in git

- Move on the branch you want to rename

```shell
git checkout -b feature/wrong-name
```

- Rename it locally

```shell
git branch -m feature/new-awesome-name
```

> If you have [ohmyzsh git plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) installed, you can use its shortcuts
> `gco -b feature/wrong-name`
> `gbm feature/new-awesome-name`

## Rename remote branch

To rename a *remote* branch is quite longer:

- Unset the upstream branch to unlink local and remote branch

```shell
git branch --unset-upstream
```

Note: if you followed the previous step, you don't have to delete local branch because you have already renamed it!

- Update the upstream branch to the new one and push it

```shell
git push --set-upstream origin feature/new-awesome-name
```

> `gpsup` (branch name is implicit)


- Delete remote branch

```shell
git push origin --delete feature/wrong-name
```

or the shortest syntax (note the space between remote name and semicolon)

```shell
git push origin :feature/wrong-name
```
