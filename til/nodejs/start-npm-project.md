To start an npm project, you have just to run `npm init` and npm will start asking you a lot of questions about how to call the project, who's the author and so on. If you are like me and have complete trust on your tools and its choices, just add `-y` at the end. It stands for _yes_ and npm will complete the boring burocrazy for you. üòè

```shell
npm init -y
```
