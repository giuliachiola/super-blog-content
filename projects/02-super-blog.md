## Project review, what I learned or improved 💪🏻

**11ty**

This was the first time I used **11ty** as static site generator and it was _amazing_! ✨

11ty supports _Nunjucks_ as template engine, and desprite the [nunjucks documentation](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) is not exaustive, I found everything I needed in forums, stackoverflow and so on. I also wrote few _TIL_ posts about what I discovered! 😏

**Nunjucks**

Unfortunately, _UIengine_ does not support Nunjucks as template engine, in fact I have had to hand-write all _EJS_ templates in Nunjucks language. I searched for a node package to automatically convert components from EJS to Nunjucks, but I didn't find one.

**Git submodules**

For the first time, I worked with _git submodules_, one for the [content repository](#) and another for the [stylegudie repository](#). At the beginning was quite hard to understand how to keep aligned (or voluntarily disaligned) all the pieces, but I understood how to use them over time... and now I am very happy to use this repository structure!
