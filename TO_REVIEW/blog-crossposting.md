## What I actually do for crossposting an article

First of all, I am a total newbie about having a blog, posting articles and I have just few followers, so... surely I am not the best at doing it, but as far as a friend asked me which steps I do to post every blog articles, I'd like to share what I do! 💪🏻 😄

### 1. Organize the ideas

I do not stare at the screen praying myself to have a brilliant idea for a new post. Surprisingly, ideas come to me doing my everyday work 🙃 When I find myself in some tricky bug or issue to resolve, I take notes about the problem I had, how I approached it and finally how I solved it (yep, also if it is just a workaround!).

I take notes with [Notion](), an awesome tool a ~collegue~ friend recommended for taking notes, to-do lists, tables and a million other things to organize all your life.

I was always a fan of Google Sheets and its tables, so I created a table in Notion to keep all my posts organized.

The table is quite simple, each row is a post and each post has some attributes:

- action (we will see it in a moment)
- post title
- status
- some checkboxes
- notes

// TODO: screenshot Notion

Getting back to the idea, when I find something that worth a blog post I add a row in my Notion table and I write down a quick recap of what was the problem and what was the solution to solve it.

### 2. Write down the post

I love writing in plain markdown with a basic distraction-free app, so I write my post using [Visual Studio Code]() as markdown editor.

*** ⚡️ Bonus tip ***

To check the markdown final result, I use the built-in Markdown Preview:

`cmd` + `shift` + `p` -> `Markdown: Open Preview` 😎

### 3. Publish the post on my blog

### 4. Publish the post on DEV.to and Hashnode (canonical url!)

### 5. Re-publish the post on my blog

### 6. Share on twitter
